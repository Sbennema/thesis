There are 7 files in this repository that are used for my thesis.

To simulate all data, we used the following two separate files for both cases:
"Simulation case1.R"
"Simulation case2.R"

Next, we used the following two files to apply the methods:
"Tandem_analysis.R"
"Simultaneous Approach.R"
Where "Tandem_analysis.R" covers the tandem approach using PCA, CA, MCA and full-dimensional clustering.
"Simultaneous Approach.R" consists of RKM, FKM, CCA and MCA K-means.

Subsequently, we analyse the the amount of subspace residuals and complement residuals in "Residuals_RKM_FKM.R".

RKM is applied to a student satisfaction survey in "Code_RKM.R".

Finally, all is run at once in "Main.R".
